## Introduction

Welcome to the Bankruptcy Prediction Project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting bankruptcy in UK retail companies based on financial ratios data from 2017 to 2021. The project aims to help retail businesses become more aware of their financial situation and identify key financial ratios that are crucial in avoiding bankruptcy risks.
